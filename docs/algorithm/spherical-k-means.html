<p><strong>Spherical k-means</strong> is an unsupervised clustering algorithm where the lengths of all vectors being compared are normalized to 1, so that they differ in direction but not in magnitude.</p>

<p>This algorithm is used when the magnitude of the vectors is irrelevant or not particularly important, especially when dealing with high-dimensional data.</p>

<p>It works by measuring the angles between the vectors (cosine similarity) rather than using the Euclidean distance as in the standard k-means algorithm.</p>

<p>For example, if you have a dataset of text documents represented as term frequency vectors, spherical k-means can cluster these documents based on their content similarity, ignoring the document lengths.</p>

<p>In summary, spherical k-means is efficient for clustering high-dimensional data where vector magnitude is not significant. 
Hence, it provides a more suitable alternative to standard k-means in specific scenarios.</p>
